Covid 19 Data Exploration 

A COVID-19 data exploration SQL project aims to analyze and gain insights from data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This project typically involves cleaning and analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL queries. 
Skills used: Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
